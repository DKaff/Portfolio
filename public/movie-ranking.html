<h1>The Best Movies According to Dakota</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>2001: A Space Odyssey</h3>
<p>The greatest film ever made began with the meeting of two brilliant minds: Stanley Kubrick and sci-fi seer Arthur C Clarke. </p>
<h3>The Godfather</h3>
<p>From the wise guys of Goodfellas to The Sopranos, all crime dynasties that came after The Godfather are descendants of the Corleones: Francis Ford Coppola’s magnum opus is the ultimate patriarch of the Mafia genre.</p>
<h3>Citizen Kane</h3>
<p>Back in the headlines thanks to David Fincher’s brilliantly acerbic making-of drama Mank, Citizen Kane always finds a way to renew itself for a new generation of film lovers.</p>
